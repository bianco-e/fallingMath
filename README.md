fallingMath is a game developed using ReactJS.

You will see a math operation, and a lot of numbers and operations "falling from the sky". You should press the right answer. If it is an operation that gets the same result your score will be increased by 1. If it is the exact result, 2 points will be added to the score. You only have 5 lifes.

ENJOY
